## Development
We are still developing and tuning these examples. If you notice issues, please log them, and if you want to contribute, submit a pull request. Input is welcome here.

Check the POM to confirm where these examples are running from. If it has SNAPSHOT in the dl4j and nd4j then *git clone* those repositories and build locally. Otherwise use Maven Repo. We are working to get this stabilized as quickly as possible.
